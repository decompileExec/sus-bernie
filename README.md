the best discord bot you have ever seen!

?help is the help command.

has a bunch of fun/troll commands that i made with discord bot maker
my favorite is ?destroy {mention}, which downloads someone's avatar, ruins it, then sends it lol

the invite is: https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=913105450197725204&permissions=517647760448&scope=bot%20applications.commands

if you want to download the code and run it yourself, you'll have to run `npm install` in order to install the dependencies for the bot to work.
